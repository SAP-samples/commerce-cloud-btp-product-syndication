# What Is A Product Syndication?

Product Syndication for SAP Commerce Cloud is a multi-tenant SaaS solution by SAP that allows pushing product data from your store to Google Merchant Center.

Products pushed to Google Content API will be available in Google Shopping ads, Google Search or YouTube.

Product syndication can be set to be pushed regularly as a whole bulk upload or include just recently modified products.

The following graphic shows simplified solution architecture:

Communication goes in one direction. Commerce Cloud sends required product data to Product Syndication using built-in Integration Services.

Product Syndication validates sent data, transforms it to Google Content API compatible format, and sends it asynchronously to Google.

Google consumes data. In case of errors, these are logged and available to review in Product Syndication logs.

SAP Commerce Cloud can optionally send just product prices through supplemental feed if needed, e.g. if prices are updated daily.

### Google Merchant Center

To use our solution, you need to make sure that on the Google side you have completed a few steps:

- Have a [Google Merchant Center](https://support.google.com/merchants/topic/7294166?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=7259125,7259405,) account created
- Have [Google Service Account](https://developers.google.com/shopping-content/guides/how-tos/service-accounts) created for Content API for Shopping
- Add [shipping options](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/6069284?hl=en) on Google Merchant Center
- If you sell in the US, [tax information](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/160162?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=7294266&amp;sjid=14602634772741637750-EU) must be configured on the Google side too

Add your Google Merchant Center account to your SAP BTP Cockpit sub-account as Destination following tutorial from [SAP Learning | Create a Destination to Connect Google Drive](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/btp-sdm-gwi-create-destination..html).

There are few differences in our configuration, as Destination should connect to [Google Content API v2.1](https://developers.google.com/shopping-content/reference/rest/v2.1):

- different URL: `https://shoppingcontent.googleapis.com/content/v2.1`
- different **Additional Properties**:
    - `siteUrl`: your base URL which should be added to your **product URL** generated by SAP Commerce Cloud (e.g., `https://www.yoursite.com`)
    - `imageUrl`: your base URL which should be added to your **product image URL** generated by SAP Commerce Cloud (e.g., `https://www.static.yoursite.com`). That is the case when clients push images to CDN. Otherwise it should be the same as `siteUrl`.
    - `currencyCodes`: your comma separated 3-letter [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) currency codes for your site for given country where you publish products. (e.g., `USD,EUR`)
    - `countryCode`: your country code (e.g., `US`) where you publish products. Country code have to be compliant with ISO 3166-1 codes (two-letter country codes)
    - `languageCode`: your language code (e.g.,`en`) for localized product content. Language code is a two-letter ISO 639-1 compliant value
    - `merchantId` your unique identifier for your store (e.g., `1234567890`). You can find that value in Google Merchant Center next with your account name
    - `channel`: it should match product's channel value (by default it should be `Online`, or `local`), more details [here](https://developers.google.com/shopping-content/reference/rest/v2.1/products#Product:~:text=9\%2C%20and%20dashes%20(%2D).-,channel,-string)
    - `jsonKey`: your Google Merchant Center JSON key file exported from your Google Cloud account for your `Service User`
    - `btpUserEmail`: your unique BTP user email address. That should be same one which will be created later on in your IdP and credentials will be used to export products from SAP Commerce Cloud

Having these information we can finally save destination.

> **Note**
>
> `btpUserEmail` should be unique key for each `Destination` configuration created in your SAP BTP sub-account. That will map product export with one destination where these data should be sent. Google Merchant center wants to have separate feeds per country, domain, language.



> **Note**
> 
> Google Merchant Center availability is limited to a list of countries. The full list of countries is available on the Google Merchant [Supported Languages and Currencies](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/160637#zippy=%2Ctarget-country-currency-local-language%2Ctarget-country-currency-supported-language) page.
